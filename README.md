# My-Portfolio
This is the code that I am currently using on my website @ www.devrichie.com/

The main website is built in ~~pure HTML, PHP, and CSS. (I challenged myself to not use JS at all for this page)~~ As of 12/5/2016, I am now allowing the addition of javascript (since I have a nice solid foundation created with pure HTML, PHP, and CSS).



Ps. The contact page is temporary right now. Eventually I'm going to add a submit form instead of just plain text. :)
