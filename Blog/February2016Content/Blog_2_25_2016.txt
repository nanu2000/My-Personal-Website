Physics s??s??? Physics!

In the last week, I have succesfully implemented <a href="#">Bullet Physics!</a>
I created a simple wrapper that accepts a shape on initialization, and will create a collidable object according to whatever shape you specify! Along with that, I made sure to add on triangle mesh capabilities! (Triangle mesh and convex hull) 

So far everything was pretty straight forward and easy to implement. I had it up and running in two days!

One of the features that I really <b><u>needed was a debug drawing system. I did NOT want to deal with invisible collision shapes, and objects not colliding properly because of it.

Luckily, bullet physics is very nice and does pretty much all of that for you! The only thing you have to do to implement debug drawing, is specify how to draw a single line in space. After that, bullet takes care of the rest.

I made a short little demonstration of everything up and running.

Everything is starting to come together, and I can definitely see all of the progress I have made in the past two (almost three) months.
It's really an exiting process, and I believe that I will be able to start working on the actual game in about a month or so (that's my plan!) 


Stay tuned!
