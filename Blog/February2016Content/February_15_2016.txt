February 15th 2016

It has been two months and 15 days since I have enrolled in this journey, some days have been quite pleasent while others have been rough. But what might make this particular day so special might you ask? Well, today is the day that I have declared the sub-journey of skeletal animation and mesh rendering to an end.

Now it is not smart to get ahead of myself and start celebrating the victory of this war, for this battle it not over. Skeletal animation is a very tough subject, but even though it have been completed, there are still other tasks that I will have to complete and declare victory upon.

As I write this note, I think to myself about the days ahead. No matter what, I will become the ruler of this kingdom. I must establish victory, because failure is not an option. 
I have a game that must be created, and a dream to pursure; this is a game that I must make, and an enviroment that I must create.

After all is said and done, to establish my progress of the past two months, I have created some video footage of my newest engine tool.


Thank you for your time,

-Sir Richard the great.
