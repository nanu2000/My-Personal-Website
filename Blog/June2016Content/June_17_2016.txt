- Before the Prototype - 

The current state of my games development would be described as the decision making, drafting and planning phase. The content embedded inside of the game so far is nothing more than a template, but that template will be the foundation of my game so it is something that I must spend time and work really hard to polish and prepare. So far the template for this project is currently composed of a character controller along with a simple animation controller.
I would love to elaborate on this template a lot more than I have so far, and a few of my future plans will include enemy AI for three different humanoid characters in the game, hand to hand combat capabilities along with weapon combat, a simple GUI (graphical user interface), and last but not least some level mechanics (moving floor, lava, ???).
My so called template will be built as a prototype. If the prototype is not fun to a large quantity of testers, then the template will be revised to suit the needs of the prototype.
The template will only include the most basic and important components that will be used in the final product.

I have created a video that shows off the newest additions to the game. There is still a lot to do, but I definitely think that I am off to a great start.


Thank you very much for reading, hopefully I will get another blog post out sooner next time :)
