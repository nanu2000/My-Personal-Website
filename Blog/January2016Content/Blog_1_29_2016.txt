A Bug
I was planning on starting the binary exporter mentioned on last weeks post, but I ran into a bug.
Pretty much, for certain complex models (with big bone hierarchys) they would not animate exactly properly. for example, the whole model would be folded in half or something alike.

I figured it was a missing bone, I was right.. But, it wasn't all that simple to fix, because when looking at Assimps "aiMesh::mNumBones", the number would be one or two bones short. 

To resolve the bug, it turns out that I also need to check the aiNodes for transformations, and treat them like bones without weight.

Here is an example of the bug.



Needless to say, after fixing the 'Missing Bone Node' bug, I feel like I really understand how skeletal animation works and how Assimp is set up as a library. Even though I spent a good week (2-8 hours a day) trying to solve this problem, I cant say that I'm mad, because I did learn a few things along the way.

Next week, I plan on adding to the animation system before I create the engine tool. I would like to have some modifier functions to change bones individually (scale, rotate, translate), a function to hide or show a mesh in a scene, and then do some cleaning of the existing code.

Lets make this a productive week :D
